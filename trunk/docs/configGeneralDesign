  the config project provides functions for management the configuration.
  - supports buildin properties: 
    this type of properties are written in the java source code. 
    So, the product can be run even without any configuration file
    the different project/product requires different set of buildin properties.
  - supports property merging:
    the same property can be defined in the different property files or buildin. 
    Provides the merging mechanism for them. 
    the merging strategy is defined in IConfigMergeStrategy
  - Properties file lookup strategy: see IPropertiesFileLookupStrategy and PropertiesFileLookupTypicalStrategy
  - Configurator: the facade of the configuration. this class delegates the getProperties() to the IPropertiesStrategy. 
    By default, this class use ConfigMergeTypicalStrategy
  - ConfigMergeTypicalStrategy:  this strategy get the properties with following sequence
    - command line properties
    - deployment configured properties: specific for one deployment
    - default configured properties: for each project, same to different deployment
    - build-in properties: properties written in source code
